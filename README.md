A simple picker which allows switching between images based on a small legend. The active picture is indicated by the "active" class and the javascript set to trigger on the "legend-picker" class. Overall the html mirrors a list of figures:

```html
<div class="legend-picker">
  <figure>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?mountain" />
    <figcaption>Mountain</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?snow" />
    <figcaption>Snow</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
```
